        The great mountain ranges are some of the most beautiful and interesting areas of the world to visit. As they are often not served by roads, they can also be the most remote and difficult places to get to and the only real way to see them is on foot. For some people the trekking may be an end in itself, for others it is a means to enjoy the magnificent panoramas and often the peoples of the mountains with their culture, traditions and religions provide an equal interest to the scenery.
                          
        <br>Cultural Treks & Expedition is a pioneer adventure trekking company, the leading organizer of tours, trekking holidays & mountaineering, with the widest choice of the destination, style and duration in Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan and Sikkim/Darjeeling (India). Whatever your interest and ability, whether you are a hardened mountain enthusiast who wants extended high-altitude trekking, peak climbing, expedition, or an occasional walker who prefers alpine footpaths, valleys and villages, we have something for you.

        A tours, trekking, mountaineering, rafting and jungle safari and other related holidays should not be exactly that a holiday, not an arduous ordeal â€“ unless, of course, that what you want. In order to help you choose the itinerary that is right for you, we give each of our holidays grade, and supply information on the number of days walking maximum and average altitudes etc, in the trip description. In addition we answer you below holidays with cost and about our services. We hope that you will find this helpful in matching your ability and aspirations to a particular holiday.
